There are several ways to solve this depending on the specific feature you're trying to use:

1. **Use Expo-compatible alternatives:** Expo provides many modules that are compatible with the managed workflow. Try searching for an Expo alternative to the native module you're using.  For example, if you are using camera, ExpoCamera is the solution.

2. **Switch to the Bare Workflow:** If the feature is essential and no Expo alternative exists, consider switching to Expo's bare workflow. This gives you complete control over the native code, allowing you to integrate the native module directly.  Be aware this increases complexity.

3. **Find a Different Approach:** Sometimes, the functionality you need can be achieved using different methods that don't rely on unsupported native modules.  Re-evaluating your design might provide a solution that works within the constraints of the managed workflow.

**Example of a possible solution (Illustrative - replace with your specific use case):**
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
// Instead of a native module, use a Javascript alternative or Expo module
// Example:  If you were using a native module for accessing camera, use ExpoCamera
// import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This solution avoids the native module error.</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
