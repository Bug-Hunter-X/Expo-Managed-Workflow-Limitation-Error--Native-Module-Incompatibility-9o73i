This error occurs when you try to use a feature or module in Expo that isn't available in the managed workflow.  For example, using a native module that requires direct interaction with the native iOS or Android code will fail in the managed workflow.  The error message itself is often not very descriptive, it might just say something like `undefined is not an object` or a similar general error.
